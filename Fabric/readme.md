## 📌 Key Topics Covered

- **OneLake architecture** and storage behavior  
- **Lakehouse structure** and data organization  
- **SQL Analytics Endpoints**  
- **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze – Silver – Gold)  
- **Data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and optimization**  
- **End-to-end analytics workflow design**

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice in Fabric

Within my Fabric Lakehouse workspace, I implemented the following:

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
- Ingested raw CSV data into OneLake
- Preserved original data structure for traceability

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- Cleaned and standardized datasets
- Handled nulls, invalid values, duplicates, and data types
- Prepared data for analytical use

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- Created curated, analytics-ready tables
- Optimized data for querying and reporting
- Enabled SQL-based analysis via Fabric SQL endpoint
